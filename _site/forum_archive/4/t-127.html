	Hi Matt / ONA Team,<br />
<br />
Just wanted to say a quick thanks for all the work you've put into this. I'm currently using it as a IPAM solution for about 1500 IPSec devices. <br />
<br />
Wanted to provide some feedback on ONA - I'd really like to use it exclusively for ALL of my network management needs, only I can't due to some current limitations. <br />
<br />
Quick overview of my network - <br />
<br />
1500 Nortel IPSec devices, using separate subnets per customer. Customer 1 could have subnet 10.1.1.0/25 for example. Customer 2 10.1.1.128/25. Etc, etc. Currently I use ONA as IPAM, a Lotus Notes DB to track inventory (it's as horrific as it sounds), a Wiki System connected to ONA to store documents, and lastly a secure DB to store backdoor admin passwords for all of the devices. That's 5 services to administer and maintain. <br />
<br />
Limitations: <br />
<br />
Associated Interfaces: I'd love to be able to put the Public ISP addresses here, but I can't unless it's in a defined subnet. <br />
<br />
Multiple IP addresses: I've seen a request here for duplicate addresses for MPLS. For me, I need multiple IP addresses to support my ITM devices (about 1500 as well) - because the management IP is on a customer controlled network. This means I have about 10 devices with the management IP of 10.1.1.1. We use proxy servers to manage these devices on a customer by customer basis. <br />
<br />
Inventory Management - This one is huge for me. OpenNetAdmin is *almost* a full IT inventory management system as well. It's missing a few things for my deployment though, mainly the ability to attach files. Each of my managed devices has to have an order request + ISP information with it. Currently I'm beta-ing a ONA setup mixed with a Wiki system and using the Wiki System to both attach files and use as a &quot;Case History&quot; per device. It's ok, but I'm not totally happy with it because it requires another server / service to manage along with passwords, users, etc. If ONA had the ability to attach files *and* have some sort of comments / customizable fields where you could use it as a &quot;Device History&quot; for changes or Notes, it'd be perfect. <br />
<br />
Lastly, password management. ONA could easily be used for this as well with the addition of some customizable fields that are not visible by a default / guest account. Sure, you can disable the guest accounts, but I need to have people able to look at the system for simple IPAM needs and device info. However, I want only my level 3 support to be able to see the password field. <br />
<br />
Config Compare: This isn't absolutely required, but as I see the RANCID support is already there and working on the site demo version - if this could be implemented, it'd be great. Not sure if it could work for Nortel configs (they are stupidly big and complicated) but I think something might be able to be hashed out. <br />
<br />
Anyway, that's it for now. Matt feel free to contact me on my GTalk if you still have it (seventil .at. gmail.com) <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

</q><br />
<br />
Feedback is one of the things that drives improvement so I'm glad to get it.  Hopefully we can come up with some solutions.<br />
<br />
I can certainly understand the desire to have a more central place to deal with all of this information.  Its one of the reasons I started ONA.<br />
<br />

Limitations: <br />
<br />
Associated Interfaces: I'd love to be able to put the Public ISP addresses here, but I can't unless it's in a defined subnet. <br />
</q><br />
<br />
I understand the need.  I have wanted to do the same a few times.  Here are the challenges:<br />
<br />
* It messes with the integrity of how data is stored<br />
* several checks and search methods will need to be updated<br />
<br />
I'll have to put some more thought into how to implement this.  I have a few ideas floating in my head on it but I'll have to play with it.  I'm thinking of allowing a subnet_id to be 0 to indicate its a more generic interface with no subnet.  I have to figure out how this impacts searches and displaying of data.  As well as how to make it intuitive to manage.   More to come......<br />
<br />

</q><br />
<br />
This one could get interesting in your environment.. I have recently implemented a few new things that could work but we'll have to discuss some details as to what might work best.  I do now have a method for what I call &quot;contexts&quot;.  This would handle separate autonomous networks for MPLS or internal/external etc when things could overlap but are never to intermingle.  It still needs more work for some of the maintenance forms but is currently usable.  With that said, I dont think its right for your situation due to its &quot;overhead&quot;.<br />
<br />
I also now have DNS view support but it does not really mean duplicate IPs.. its just a way to do split horizon for DNS.  you might be able to use this however to track the info in a way unrelated to its intended DNS purposes??<br />
<br />
There is also the interface sharing option but it is more intended for HSRP,VRRP, CARP type setups.<br />
<br />
I'll need to get a bit more detail on the requirements for this.<br />
<br />

</q><br />
<br />
I think this is a prime case for a plugin or two.  Attaching files is something that could be done via a plugin pretty easily I would suspect.  Since there are many ways that people might want to use this, then a plugin is the right way to go for that.  Another option for some user customizable data is the &quot;custom attributes&quot; functionality.  you can define your own item to track and then you can set values for that item.  It might help out.<br />
<br />
Also if you happen to use the Puppet system management tool, I have some plugins that expose &quot;fact&quot; data gathered by puppet.  This is good if you manage many unix systems.<br />
<br />
As far as case history/comments.. I do actually have a tool in place that might be useful for that?  Its the &quot;message_add&quot; dcm module.  There is no GUI way to manage the data other than to view the messages for a host or subnet.  It was originally intended to loosely tie into notification queues.  There is a priority for each message as well as an expiration date.  Give it a look and see if it is helpful in any way.  It could probably be turned into something more.<br />
<br />

<br />
</q><br />
<br />
I believe you and I talked about this several months ago.  I had some initial ideas on it but we never got around to finishing the thoughts on it.  I think its something that could be set up fairly easily.<br />
<br />
<q cite="&amp;quot;dmo&amp;quot;:1utue5x9"><br />
Config Compare: This isn't absolutely required, but as I see the RANCID support is already there and working on the site demo version - if this could be implemented, it'd be great.

<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
The config compare stuff is already there.. the part you are essentially missing is a method to get the nortel config files into the config tables in ONA.  the dcm module config_add will get them in there.  I've not played with it much but I think it would be reasonably easy to take the Rancid login scripts and use them to get the configs and then push them into ONA.  There are a few things abount Rancid that I didnt care for on the Cisco side of things so I ended up implementing my own login methods.  <br />
<br />
I do still have your GTalk info.. I'll try and get with you sometime soon.. its  pretty busy at work right now so my days are consumed.</q></q></q></q></q></q>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Also,  just went back and read the past posts you had about the config compare.  I didnt put it together that it was you <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) -->.. <br />
<br />
This just goes to show that I need to be bugged more often since I tend to forget about things.. or more specifically, I only work on the stuff that *I* need at the time or that the most people are talking with me about at the time.  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) -->..  I still have intentions on getting the more robust config compare thing.. it just sank to the bottom of my priorities..<br />

Just keep buggin me!	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
