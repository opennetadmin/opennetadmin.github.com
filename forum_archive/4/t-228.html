	Hello. I'm new to this, so I apologize if this seems trivial.<br />
<br />
So the problem I'm having is after adding a new host to a subnet, I can't see the new host in the list on the display page for the subnet. It looks like its trying to load, then I get a pop-up saying the server returned a 500 status.  So I checked the apache logs, and I see this error multiple times:<br />
<br />
PHP Warning:  fopen(/var/log/ona.log): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /var/www/ona/www/include/functions_general.inc.php on line 12<br />
<br />
I've checked that the log file has proper permissions to allow it to be written to. I'm not sure what is wrong.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	The /var/log/ona.log file must be writable by your web server.  if a 'chmod 666 /var/log/ona.log' does not fix the problem then you may have something else in place like apparmor or some other system level restriction not allowing the file to be written to.<br />
<br />
You could also try changing the log path to somewhere else if you can access the system config settings in ONA.  If not it would require a SQL update directly to the sys_config table in your database.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Looks like it's an selinux problem; I'll have to get a policy written for it.  Thanks for the help.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
