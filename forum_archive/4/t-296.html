	Dear Mat,<br />
      I want to do some modify on ONA as the following:<br />
1.When i fisrt time to add a host, I do not want give it a DNS name, I want to change the DNS name and DNS domain become a option not required. some host is just a PC, A DNS name is not necessary.<br />
2.I do not need the host actions module, how can i &quot;//&quot; this module?<br />
3.I have seen a option &quot;security_level&quot; in the /ona/www/modules/ona/host.inc.php, But i can not find any filed to fill this option. Where can i find this?<br />
Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely<br />

	1. It is a requirement to give a name to every host.  this is used to identify the host within ONA.  It is not required that the name be a 'real' DNS name but the requirement will remain that all hosts have some sort of name.  You could simply name them pc01, pc02 etc etc<br />
2. I do have plans to make it easier to disable this module.  I for now you can comment out all the $conf entries in 'www/workspace_plugins/builtin/host_actions/config.inc.php' to disable it.<br />
3. Security level is leftover code for something that once existed.  It is not implemented currently and does not do anything at the moment.  there are plans to implement a host/subnet level security model but that is a ways out.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
