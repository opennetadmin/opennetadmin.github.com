	I've been asked to present/introduce OpenNetAdmin to the rest of my team at our next meeting, and given that I only really stumbled across it, and know nothing more than the little I have read on the website, I was wondering if there were any slides or screencasts or anything anywhere which might do the job for me <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title=":-D" /><!-- s:D -->  German is preferred, but I think English would also be acceptable too.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Alas, I've been far too busy (but mostly lazy) to get anything like that done.  However I have been recently experimenting with screencast solutions to show off more of ONA.  Keep bugging me to give me some motivation to get it done! <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) -->.. As far as the German, I wont be able to help you there <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) -->... Though anyone willing to take one of the screencasts I provide and record a new voice track, I can probably swap that out and make other versions??<br />
<br />
Thanks for the request.. I'll see what I can do.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
