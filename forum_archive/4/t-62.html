	Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to using ONA for my network but I'd like to insert several hostname without IP address (DHCP client) and with notes.<br />
This because I'd like to know that in a specific subnet there a hostname with a specific name and notes.<br />
So, is there a way to bypass the request of the IP address, or is there another way to do this?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

	ONA is specifically designed for tracking IPs and names.  At this time there is no way to track only a name without an IP.  I would however expect that you do have a hostname and an IP for these devices.  If it is a static DHCP lease then you can certainly add it to ONA.  If the IP is within a defined DHCP pool range however you would be unable to track that in ONA today.  <br />
<br />
I am working on getting a DHCPLEASEQUERY component set up such that when you navigate to a subnet in ONA it will display information about the DHCP leases.  This will be a much better improvement but will only be a lookup so you will not have notes associated with it.  <br />
<br />
There are other tools I have not fully released yet that do nmap scans and other audit related things that could be made to show this information as well.  Again, no notes however.<br />
<br />
I'm working on a new plugin framework so maybe things could be extended that way.  I dont expect this functionality to be part of the core ONA system however.<br />
<br />
Hope that answers your questions.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
