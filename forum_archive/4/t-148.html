	Dear All,<br />
<br />
Have installed and setup 9.9.15 and there are no reports listed. Have I missed something?<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely<br />

	There are currently no reports installed by default.  That functionality is brand new (and still being worked out actually).<br />
<br />
There are a few plugins (yet to be released) that provide some reports.  Otherwise there are no standalone reports currently released.  I do have a few in the works in various forms however.  <br />
<br />
If anyone out there has any reports they would like to see post them here and I'll see what we can do.<br />
<br />
Thanks.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
