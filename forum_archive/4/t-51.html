	Hi there,<br />
<br />
after inserting a new host to a domain which has a subdomain often the host is linked to the wrong domain.<br />
<br />
Somebody has the same feature?<br />
<br />
Bye,<br />

<br />
j99s-pwin01.backup<br />

	I know of a few possible issues but I'll need to know a bit more detail.  It looks like you have a domain_id of 17 in your examples.  what is the acutal name of this domain?  <br />
<br />
If you could give me a few examples of some domains and subdomains that you have as well as the fully qualified names you are trying to add to them it would help.  Also please indicate the &quot;host&quot;  part and the &quot;domain&quot; part of the FQDNs you are adding.  for instance:<br />
<br />
host1.sub  domain.com<br />
or<br />
host1  sub.domain.com<br />
or<br />
host1  domain.com<br />
<br />
thanks	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
