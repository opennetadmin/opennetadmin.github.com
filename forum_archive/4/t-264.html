	Hey, my english isn't very well, but let me try to explain my problem. <br />
<br />
I'm using 'OpenNetAdmin' for 3 month. I have to put the old data in this new System. <br />
I want to create an A record with one IP-Adress and two names. Is that possible?<br />
Can somebody help me?<br />
<br />

	Yes you can do this no problem.  Simply use the add DNS record form and add an A record as you need.  Do keep in mind that you may need to un-check the create PTR button since you can only have one PTR record per IP address. <br />
<br />
You can add for instance the following combinations of A records:<br />
<br />
name1.example.com  IN  A  1.1.1.1<br />
name2.example.com  IN  A  1.1.1.1<br />
name3.example.com  IN  A  2.2.2.2<br />
name3.example.com  IN  A  3.3.3.3<br />
<br />
You can see all the resulting records by clicking on the domain name and viewing the list.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	There are several ways to export data from ONA.<br />
<br />
1. Simply write SQL queries to extract data from the database using your favorite tool<br />
2. use dcm.pl and the ona_sql module which allows you to write SQL queries.  There are a few default saved queries available when you use the 'list' option<br />
3. other ONA plugins can be written to provide data.  There is a reporting function that can be used to create and display things in the GUI or via CLI.  For instance the nmap scan plugin has a report built into it that can export data.<br />
4. there are also dns and dhcp configuration build plugins that will extract data and output compatible configuration files for several different types of servers.<br />
<br />
There are a few current options here but it all depends on your need.  There are ways to create data extractions that suit just about any need.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
