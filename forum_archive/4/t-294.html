	I notice you are trying to install under Windows.  While ONA is simple PHP code, there are several things within it that were implemented in a way that will likely not work on windows.  <br />
<br />
It is likely that some effort could be made to fix up some of these issues so the core of ONA works under windows but that is low on my priority list and so far has not had much focus.  I'm not currently aware of anyone who has successfully gotten ONA working on windows.<br />
<br />
Your best bet is a linux VM.  I hope to be getting a <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://turnkeylinux.org"><a href="http://turnkeylinux.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--">http://turnkeylinux.org</a><!--</a> m --> image set up soon that will allow people to easily set up an ONA box.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
