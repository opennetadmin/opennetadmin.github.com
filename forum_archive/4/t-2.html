	Well, I finally got around to redoing the site.  Hope you like it.<br />
<br />
Let me know if something is not working or you think something could be better.  I've not set many features in the forum so we might find that something could be added so just let me know.<br />
<br />
Also, the old forum posts are still around.  BUT I need to work on converting them over.  I'll get to that when I can.  For those of you who created logins in the forum before, you'll need to set up a new account.<br />
<br />
The good news is the Bug tracking system was converted fully so your user accounts are still there.  Also email should be working in the Bug tracker and the Forum so you will be notified (if you have it enabled) when things change.<br />
<br />
Thanks again and enjoy!	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
