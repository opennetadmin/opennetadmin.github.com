	i've uploaded configs to a single host (3 configs to be exact)<br />
<br />
the upload seems to go fine<br />
i see three configs under said host in the GUI<br />
<br />
i attempt to view a config or diff the configs and i get nothing.  by nothing i mean the GUI exists - theres an obvious place where the config should be shown but it is not.<br />
<br />
i have debug cranked up to 6 and am watching it as i make the request - but there are no errors or failures that i'm seeing.  any thoughts would be nice.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Hmm.. quite interesting.<br />
<br />
First off, I would try to do a &quot;dcm.pl -r config_display&quot; to see if the config will show up there with what you expect.<br />
<br />
When you have it in the GUI and you click the magnifying glass it should display the config file itself.  It should have a blue box that gives info on that configuration.  Do you see that blue box and no config? or no blue box at all either?<br />
<br />
Since there is no GUI (as you found based on the bug you opened) to maintain the config types, you would only have &quot;IOS_CONFIG&quot; and &quot;IOS_VERSION&quot; as an option unless you manually created your own.  Its possible when you added the configuration that there was a problem with the config type??<br />
<br />
I also assume that you DO see the configuration entries in the list but just nothing when you try to view/diff it?<br />
<br />
Nothing really solid yet to suggest other than the CLI display method.  Keep feeding me other details that you notice..	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yep sure does, here's an example :<br />

<q>When you have it in the GUI and you click the magnifying glass it should display the config file itself.  It should have a blue box that gives info on that configuration.  Do you see that blue box and no config? or no blue box at all either?<br />

<br />
when i click that magnifying glass i get a workspace with a loading type image - that never goes away.<br />
<br />

<br />
as you see above its IOS_CONFIG and in the gui list it shows the same.<br />
<br />
<q>I also assume that you DO see the configuration entries in the list but just nothing when you try to view/diff it?</q><br />
<br />
correct<br />

	Not a dang clue.. been pre-occupied with some things so I've honestly not put all 5 of my brain cells on the task.<br />
<br />
I've been unable to recreate the same issue.  It is possible I have fixed this since my last release.  Since it has been WAY to long since I've put out a release, I plan on doing one this weekend.  Hopefully that will fix your problem.<br />
<br />
In the mean time, when I run into issues where there is no obvious error message on screen or in logs I will do the following.<br />
<br />
From a cli try to execute the code and see if there are some sort of php errors being logged.  (if you dont already have a php error log generated, it might be good to have one on but thats usually best for development work.)  In this case I would try this command:<br />
<br />
<code>php /opt/ona/www/winc/display_config_text&#46;inc&#46;php</code><br />
<br />
If it goes to a prompt then thats not the problem.. If it spits out an error, it should say the line number that has the issue.<br />
<br />
Lets see where that gets us.....................</code>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

buncha notices.  usually not problematic - depending on when those get defined its not a big deal (usually happens after a submit button or the like).  but again it really depends on the process flow</code>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	hmm, no errors there.. those notices are normal.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the heck it is.. I'd say lets try the new release that I'm building and see if that fixes it.  If not, I'll dig in deeper.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	So the updated file didn't cut it either.  I'll look forward to the next release and in the meantime keep working on a way to backup my routers automagically <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) -->   (at least until you release some of the fun utilities mentioned in the docs!)	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	so - using the most current release from Matt,<br />
<br />
I can now view and diff my configs without problem.  it is possible that there were escape characters killing the config view in the current stable release version - i cannot test that at the moment.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Well I have confirmed the problem is real CTRL-C characters.  Now I just need to get a workable solution.  I think I have a plan on it, just need to test.  <br />
<br />
Basically I'm going to store the file as is in the database.  My configs already have CTRL-M on each line so that is not an issue.  I'll just clean out the CTRL-C stuff before I try to print it via the browser.  Should fix the issue.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
