I try to install ONA 11.02.10<br />

The database is created in the server. but I have this error in the logs.<br />

Sorry I've not replied sooner.  busy busy busy.. <br />
<br />
I'm not too sure why it is you are getting this error in the first place.  it might be worth digging into that a bit more.<br />
<br />
As far as having a way to manually create the database and initial data load.  This is something that I've overlooked thus far when I switched to the .xml based files.  My plan is to start including updated .sql files so that people can manually load the tables and initial data if they need to.  This is not something that is currently set up at this time.<br />
<br />
However, you could try to do the following:<br />
<br />
in /opt/ona/install you can load ona-tables.sql then load ona-data.sql.<br />
<br />
once that is loaded to your database, try and run the installer to see if it picks up and does a proper upgrade.  its a 50/50 shot but something to try at least.  <br />
<br />
I will be working on getting updated .sql files that will work better.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	So It would seem that there is an issue with mysql 5.5 that they changed how the define the database type.  Key word is no longer &quot;TYPE=innodb&quot; it is now &quot;ENGINE=innodb&quot;.<br />
<br />
So until I get this fixed up permanently, you can either downgrade your mysql or edit the /opt/ona/install/ona-table_schema.xml file and change from TYPE to ENGINE.<br />
<br />
I hope to have this fixed soon.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
