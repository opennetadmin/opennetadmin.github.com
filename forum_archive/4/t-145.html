	I've noticed on a number of occasions that spam is getting posted on the forum. Any chance of adjusting some settings to stop it?<br />
<br />
Maybe require moderator approval for the first 3 or so posts per user, and name a few moderators to keep things happening...<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I'd be happy to nominate myself as a moderator if need be.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thanks for the offer.  I've added you as a moderator to the general discussion for now.  <br />
<br />
I've also added a few custom fields during registration which should help with the bots.  Hopefully that will eliminate most of the problem.  I need to upgrade to a newer version of phpbb but dont have the time right now to do that.  Looks like the latest version has lots of antispam stuff.<br />
<br />
we'll see what the custom fields can do and go from there.. thanks again!	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
