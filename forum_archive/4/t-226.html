	Hi,<br />
first, thanks a lot for this great tool <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) --><br />
I'm currently in v10.05.27 and just want to ask if there is no problem for upgrading to the last version when using build_bind and build_dhcpd ?<br />
<br />
I'm using v10.05.27 since about 10 months and i dont want to break it when i upgrade...<br />
I'm really interested in the rack maintenance tool and the ldap backend<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

	I am not aware of any issues that would cause an impact to you if you are already using the those two build scripts.  You should be just fine.<br />
<br />
However, in saying that I would still suggest to you that you make a copy of your /opt/ona directory in case you want to revert back to what you had before.  And also do a backup of your mysql database.  I would always expect that any code that I give out has the chance of turning your data into dust, so take proper precautions. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) -->  It should be a simple upgrade and a simple backup/restore type process though so I'd say go for it.<br />
<br />
If you have any issues let me know.. I hang out on IRC in the #ona channel of freenode.net.  Plus there are others there that could help as well.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
