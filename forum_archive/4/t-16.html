	so if you note below - im using config_diff - but the synopsis mention config_display<br />
<br />
and it also states that if no ida or idb is included it'll grab the most recent.<br />
<br />
but when i run it - all that happens is what is seen.  i verified that the host id is accurate (but i did try it with the hostname too) and i get no output - just the help again.<br />
<br />
something perhaps pointing incorrectly?<br />
<br />
[tyoung@ipplan dcm-v1.17]$ perl dcm.pl -r config_diff host=26<br />
Use of uninitialized value in numeric eq (==) at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/IO/Socket/SSL.pm line 1185.<br />

  Synopsis: config_display [KEY=VALUE] ...<br />
<br />
  Required:<br />
    host=ID or NAME[.DOMAIN]    display most recent config for specified host<br />
    type=TYPE                   type of config to display -<br />
                                  usually &quot;IOS_VERSION&quot; or &quot;IOS_CONFIG&quot;<br />
  Optional:<br />
    ida=ID                      First config ID to compare against idb<br />
    idb=ID                      Second config ID to compare against ida<br />
<br />
  Note:<br />
    If you don't pass any IDs you will get the two most recent configs<br />
    related to the host/type you provide.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	First off, I'll fix the name in the help output to config_diff as it should be...<br />
<br />
Second it looks like it is failing due to no type option.  Host and type are both required options.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note:<br />
<br />
The SSL.pm related perl error you are getting could be disabled by adjusting the dcm.conf file appropriately.  Depending on how you have your environment you can get the SSL stuff working fully, or if you dont need it you could adjust some of the following options as needed for your environment:<br />
<br />
<code><br />
    'ssl'                    =&gt; 0,                             ## Did the uri specify http or https?<br />
    'sslAvailable'           =&gt; 0,                             ## Does this perl installation support SSL?<br />
    'sslWarning'             =&gt; 1,                             ## Warn on STDERR when connection is insecure<br />
</code><br />
<br />
These weren't really documented much so I figured I'd mention them here.</code>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	ahh heres a problem :<br />
<br />
ERROR =&gt; This command requires the xdiff pecl module, which is not installed, please see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pecl.php.net/package/xdiff"><a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/xdiff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--">http://pecl.php.net/package/xdiff</a><!--</a> m --><br />
<br />
time to go rectify that!<br />
<br />
as for the SSL stuff above - that error doesn't bother me any - and i can certainly go take care of it <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) -->	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Good deal the check worked to see if xdiff was there or not.  It should be fairly easy to get installed.<br />
<br />
Yea I figured the SSL stuff was not an issue for you.  I usually leave it alone on most of my boxes as well.  Figured I'd throw the comment in about it just in case someone else wanted to know how to get rid of it.<br />
<br />
Later....	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br />
interesting.  installed xdiff - but still doesn't see it.  php -m sure does.<br />
<br />
its gotta be looking in the wrong place (although i'd assume it'd basically just check php -m for 'xdiff')</q>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	PHP is a fun one sometimes.  When you do a php -m at the CLI it is invoked right then and there and would probably show correctly (it even can parse a different php.ini file than the web server does)<br />
<br />
I think the issue is that you need to restart apache.  Apache loads up those php modules etc on startup so even though it is installed and the CLI sees it, Apache wont until the restart.  Apache is involved because the code that runs via DCM is really just the php code on the web server.  <br />
<br />
Thats my guess for now.. give it a shot.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
