	Hi, I need to add NS records to the reverse zones, in the DNS Server of my organization is done like that.<br />
<br />
An example can be:<br />
<br />
19.172.in-addr.arpa. NS unimur.um.es<br />
<br />
However, everytime I want to add it, ONA says that Only PTR records should use in-addr domains<br />
<br />
How can I solve this?<br />
<br />
I have just migrated all my old database (for several weeks) to ONA and I think I cannot continue with this trouble <!-- s:-( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title=":-(" /><!-- s:-( --><br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
P.D.: I have tried this with dcm.pl but I get the same result.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Yes an NS record is required for pretty much every zone that is created.  It is not exactly obvious within ONA that the NS records are handled automatically by assigning a DNS server host to a domain.<br />
<br />
There are three ways to do this.  Navigate to your unimur.um.es host in ONA and then click on the DNS line of &quot;managed services on this host&quot;.  On the next screen you will assign all of the domains that this server is either a master or secondary for.  When you do this, an NS record will automatically be created for the domain.<br />
<br />
The second way is to navigate to the 19.172.in-addr.arpa domain and then click the &quot;assign to server&quot; button in the DNS servers box.<br />
<br />
The last way is via DCM using the &quot;domain_server_XXX&quot; commands.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Hi Matt, if you remember, we was talking about this last night. Now, I am at work and I have just tried all ways you told me (even adding an NS server for a reverse zone in-addr... with dcm.pl) but I get the same result, only PTR records bla bla bla...<br />
<br />
As I told you last conversation, I have been looking for some IF condition about this issue, founding it easily. This is the change I have made in the file '/opt/ona/www/modules/ona/dns_record.inc.php', at line 173:<br />
<br />
if (strpos($domain['fqdn'], &quot;in-addr.arpa&quot;) and $options['type'] != 'PTR' <strong>and $options['type'] != 'NS'</b>) {<br />
   printmsg(&quot;ERROR =&gt; Only PTR records should use in-addr.arpa domains!&quot;, 3);<br />
   ...<br />
   ...<br />
}<br />
<br />
Of course, the new code is the bold portion.<br />
<br />
At the moment, this is the solution for me. I think (as you told me) that the next release will patch this.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps somebody too.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help, Matt.</strong>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Yep, that is pretty much the fix that needed to happen.. I released the new version last night however so you might want to  go ahead and upgrade to it as well since it fixes that and many other things..   Thanks.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
