	I have a new install of ONA on a Ubuntu 10.04 server.  I have everything up and running but the nmap cron job.  I can manually submit the command and specify a subnet to scan with the -n parm, but I can not run the command any other way.  If I do the -l parm I get an &quot;ERROR =&gt; The requested module is not valid!&quot; message.  It seems like it will not look at the ONA database to get the list of subnets to scan.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Its possible your environment does not have all it needs when running from cron.  If you are able to use dcm.pl with no issues from your normal login then I think you'll need to check into crons environment.  It needs to be able to find its config file etc<br />
<br />
my /etc/cron.d/ona file looks like this:<br />
<code><br />
# Please store only OpenNetAdmin related cron entries here&#46;<br />
#ONABASE=`cat /etc/onabase`<br />
PATH=/usr/local/sbin&#58;/usr/local/bin&#58;/usr/sbin&#58;/usr/bin&#58;/sbin&#58;/bin/&#58;/opt/ona/bin<br />
<br />
# Perform a daily nmap ping scan and update last_response<br />
# Found it is best to ping during the day to pick up laptops that might be gone at night<br />
0 11 * * * root nmap_scan_cron -u -a &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
</code><br />
<br />
The PATH statement at the top ensures it can find stuff in the ONA bin directory.  <br />
<br />
One other thing to make sure of is that the command &quot;dcm.pl --list&quot; returns a list of modules.  specifically look for &quot;ona_sql&quot;.. <br />
<br />
then try this command to see if it works correctly for you <br />
<code><br />
dcm&#46;pl -l admin  -r ona_sql header=no sql=nmap_subnets_only_yes&#46;sql<br />
</code><br />
<br />
This is what nmap_scan_cron does to get the list of subnets from the database.  You must set the -a option for nmap_scan_cron to get all subnets or you must set the custom attribute &quot;nmap_scan&quot; to Y for the subnets you want to scan.<br />
<br />
hope that helps.  Thanks</code></code>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
