	Has anyone generated basic Nagios configs from the host info in the ONA DB?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

	I would love to have a plugin for doing this at some point.  I've not yet gotten around to building anything as it is a pretty complex set of things to enable (or at least it CAN be).<br />
<br />
Any ideas here would be great.<br />
<br />
As it stands I've got a few thoughts:<br />
* In my environment, I use Puppet.. it has nagios config generation modules and I have the puppet external node plugin so puppet will get its info from ONA.  This needs much more work I'm sure.<br />
* Utilize <a>http&#58;//opennetadmin&#46;com/docs/utils/template_merge</a>.  This is a tool that you could use to template your basic host/services info for a nagios config.  Then names,IP addresses etc could be pulled from ONA.  This one would not be as generic for everyone to use but I think could be made to work fairly easily.<br />
* create tables for storing  nagios data in ONA.. this is not great as it takes time and probably wouldn't be flexible enough.<br />
<br />
Anyway.. I have a few ideas on it obviously but nothing remotely useable.  It certainly can be done and I hope will be done at some point.  I use Nagios regularly and would love for it to be tied to ONA!</a>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
