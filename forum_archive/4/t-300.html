	I would highly suggest not changing this field to something else.  there are several parts of the system that use it and it wont be as simple as just changing the DB and those few php files.  Plus when a new release comes out you will have to make changes to the files again.<br />
<br />
What is this field for?  is it Serial Number?  Another thought would be to use the custom attributes system to define information.  Its not always the best option but it is available to use for custom things.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
