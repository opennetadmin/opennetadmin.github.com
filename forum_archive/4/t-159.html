	I'm trying to install OpenNetAdmin version v10.05.27 on a Centos 4 box.<br />
<br />
docs/INSTALL doesn't list a php version requirement.  <br />
<br />
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://opennetadmin.com/docs/installation"><a href="http://opennetadmin.com/docs/installation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--">http://opennetadmin.com/docs/installation</a><!--</a> m --> says &quot;PHP version 4 or newer&quot;<br />
<br />
When I follow the install instructions &amp; try to open the initial web page it comes up blank.  My apache error_log shows this:<q>[client 127.0.0.1] PHP Parse error:  parse error, unexpected T_STATIC, expecting T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or '}' in /opt/ona/www/include/adodb5/adodb.inc.php on line 434</q><br />
<br />
My gut tells me that I really need php5.  Is this correct, or have I missed an obvious step?<br />
<br />
Relevant packages that are installed:<br />
php-snmp-4.3.9-3.29<br />
php-odbc-4.3.9-3.29<br />
php-mysql-4.3.9-3.29<br />
php-adodb-4.52-1<br />
php-4.3.9-3.29<br />
php-pear-4.3.9-3.29<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</q>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	The short answer is yes, it really should be PHP5.<br />
<br />
I had upgraded to the newer ADODB drivers and I believe it requires 5 now.  There are a few other things that have crept in feature wise that will require something newer than 4.  <br />
<br />
I will update the requirements doc to say 5.. also the check in the installer for php version will be incremented.<br />
<br />
I have yet to gauge how annoying of a requirement it will be for people.  I would hope that by now most people are in the php5 realm but I realize that there are situations where that is not possible.<br />
<br />
I will try and do an assessment on it and see if it is something that can be worked around or if the requirement should really stand. <br />
<br />
If you cant upgrade to php5 you might try a v09.x.x version of ONA until I can look into it more.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	I generally try to keep with the &quot;vendor provided&quot; packages, and for centos4/rhel4 that means php4.  That distribution is getting pretty long in the tooth though, and all new machines are using rhel5.<br />
<br />
Anyways - I installed php5 &amp; then re-tried ONA.  Things worked without any issue - so now on to the fun part:  configuring.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Ok so I looked at it again and apparently when I upgraded the adodb driver last time I was not really paying much attention to the fact that they offer two versions.. one that is php5 only and one that supports both 4 and 5.<br />
<br />
At this point, anyone requiring the use of php4 should be able to get the latest adodb code from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/adodb/files/adodb-php-4-and-5/"><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/adodb/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/adodb/</a> ... p-4-and-5/</a><!-- m -->.<br />
<br />
Then you can put it in /opt/ona/www/include and then adjust the symbolic link /opt/ona/www/include/adodb to point at the new adodb directory.  It currently points at adodb5.  Obviously this has not been tested but I dont see any reason it would cause issues.<br />
<br />
Unless I hear a ton of objections, I will probably just leave the php5 requirement in for now.  If you think it should not require php5 then let me know!	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
