	Hello all,<br />
<br />
I just wanted to post a quick comment to let everyone know why things have been going so slow around here lately.<br />
<br />
First off, I have been busy at work.. thats the easy part.  Around November/December timeframe I added some pretty large changes to some internal structure of ONA that I needed to do more thorough testing with before releasing so I didnt drop a bomb on anyones data.  <br />
<br />
This testing has slowed to a halt due to the fact that both of my parents were diagnosed with cancer.  My father passed away last week and of course you can imagine, things are busy.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just wanted to mention this so people knew what was up and why I've not been so active with things.  My family and I are in good cheer and are happy in the knowledge that my father had a good life and is now in Heaven with our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ.  So don't feel sorry, you can be happy with us too! <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) --><br />
<br />
Life will go on and when things are in order I'll get back on the ONA bandwagon.....  And please dont stop posting your questions and comments as they are what drive ONA onward and upward.  I will answer them!<br />
<br />
Thanks again.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
