	I played around with the &quot;Begin&quot; feature you can use while editing DNS records. While the setting of a concrete date works as expected, the &quot;disable&quot; Button does not. The 'Effective' column is not giving any hint that a particular DNS record ist disabled. (The ebegin timestamp in the database is set to all zero though) Also, if you edit a 'disabled' record again, the disable button is not checked. So doing a save in that condition 'reenables' the record by updating ebegin to the actual timestamp.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something here or is this a bug? ONA Version is 10.05.27	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	When digging into the situation you described, I found a few other incorrect behaviors related to ebegin... I think I have them fixed now and have checked in my changes.  More testing is in order but I was able to disable a record, future date it and change IPs around and all the values remained as I expected them to be.  You are correct that the disable button should remain  checked and not reenable the record when you edit it.<br />
<br />
It will be in the next release	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
