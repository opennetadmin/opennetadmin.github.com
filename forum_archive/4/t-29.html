	I have multiple sub-delegated domain and I've entered each on into ONA. The master is delegated on a different server outside of ONA.<br />
<br />
Example.  dns domains delegated in ONA --&gt; example.com (forward) and 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa  and 2.168.192.in-addr.arpa (reverses)<br />
<br />
and when I change a hosts ip/subnet the PTR record gets appended wrong.<br />
<br />
For example...<br />
<br />
host &quot;test.example.com&quot; IP 192.168.1.1 needs changing to 192.168.2.1. I update the IP from the interface field selecting the IP from the different subnet. After updating the PTR is wrong.<br />
PTR was 1.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa<br />
now its 1.2.168.192.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa instead of 1.2.168.192.in-addr.arpa<br />
<br />
Is this a known issue? Other then going in and changing the domain_id in mysql.... the only way I see is to delete the record entirely and recreate it with the new IP which regenerates the PTR.<br />

	This is a bug I've not encountered yet.  I think there are a few similar bugs floating around.  If you dont mind, go open a bug report on this in the ticket system so I dont loose track.  <br />
<br />
I'll have a look at it and hopefully have a fix soon.. I suspect this will help fix a few of the other issues that have been encountered around some of the domain processing.<br />
<br />
Thanks!	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
