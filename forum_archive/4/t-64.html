	Hello ,<br />
           I am trying to build a tinydns server with the information from the opennet database. My question/problem is that this site says it has a tool to build the tinydns but does not have any steps for migrating the information from one to the other. Cand anyone point me in the right direction for a &quot; how to&quot; to get this done? Thanks...	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
