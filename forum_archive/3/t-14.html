	So the documentation references a bunch of other tools.  Most of them in this case are cisco based - but there are no download links - yet there seems to be plenty of documentation.<br />
<br />
Certainly they must be semi-usable?  can we try to break stuff with em?	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	They are semi (more than that in fact) usable.   I'm in the midst of some changes on them right now so I'd like to get those in prior to giving them out.   Some of these tools are also in the realm of tools that I was considering charging a small fee for.  I've not decided on all that yet.  <br />
<br />
Now is certainly the time to get some beta testers on it.  I've got a few already interested (that I've been holding up for far too long on!) so I'll try and get them out to a few of you to have a go at.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
