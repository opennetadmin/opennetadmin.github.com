	Ok, so I've been using ONA for a little over 2 years to maintain records on our network and IP assignments.  We just received a block of IPv6 addresses from ARIN (an absolutely obseen number of addresses  I might add :^) and I need to manage them as I do our v4 blocks.<br />
<br />
I read a comment from Matt that the devel release supports v6 so I upgraded our server and tried it.  No good.  There's not even enough space in the form entries to accommodate the addresses.<br />
<br />
So, I've been looking through the files, but I've not done any coding in 15 years or more, and most of what I used to do was nothing like this stuff, so I would appreciate some pointers at what I should start looking at.  I assume that the DB will need to be modified to accommodate these addresses.  I also know that the web pages will have to be modified.  That else do I likely need to look into and check?<br />
<br />

	Yes ipv6 is a totally crazy amount of addresses!.. <br />
<br />
So, as it stands right now, the current code release tarball that is available via our download pages does not contain any IPv6 functionality.  It is a task still remaining to fully merge the ipv6 branch back into the main code base.  The more testing that can be done the better when it comes to that.<br />
<br />
For anyone willing to do some testing you should be able to do the following:<br />
<br />
svn co <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://opennetadmin.com/svn/ona/branches/ipv6/"><a href="http://opennetadmin.com/svn/ona/branches/ipv6/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--">http://opennetadmin.com/svn/ona/branches/ipv6/</a><!--</a> m --> ona-ipv6<br />
<br />
That will check out the current ipv6 code to the directory ona-ipv6.  For right now I dont have all the install scripts updated to convert the database to using IPv6.  You will have to point this at a new database instance for now.  But you can at least define your subnets/hosts etc to test it out at that level.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps for now.  Still working on it.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
