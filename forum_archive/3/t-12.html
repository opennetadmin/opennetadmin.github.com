	So here is a new thing I'm playing around with.  <br />
<br />
The ability to keep track of a &quot;rack&quot; in a datacenter/closet etc.  So far its pretty basic.  It has the ability to track a name, the size of the rack and the utilization of that rack.<br />
<br />
Devices within ONA can be linked to what set of &quot;units&quot; or &quot;U&quot; they consume in the rack.  If there are things like patch panels or PDUs etc that do not have a host in ONA they can still be tracked.  You can indicate if it was installed from the front or the back of the rack and if it has a depth of 1/4, half, 3/4, or full.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just something I'm playing around with.  The graphical representation of the rack is pretty well there but I have no edit ability and I need to display a bit more useful info about each rack unit.<br />
<br />
It has also been suggested that having ONA conform in some way to TIA/EIA 606A would be a good thing.  I agree but have not spent time thinking on how to conform to those standards but I see it is within the realm of possibility and that this is a small portion of that whole mess of things.<br />
<br />
Here is a screen shot as well.  Let me know what you think!	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Looks interesting. I normally track this sort of stuff in Visio. <br />
<br />
I'd be happy to test it out for you if you need some feedback. I have a few racks in my lab I need to update anyway. <br />

	Adding that functionality would certainly be useful.<br />
We are currently using Rack Monkey,<br />

It works pretty well for tracking hardware but its missing some key features (like storing interface info) its not plugin friendly, its not modular, it has no API to make it play nice with others, and modifying the code to get it to do what you want is somewhat daunting. None the less it does what it does fairly well and its pretty stable, until I saw this post I sang high praise for Rack Monkey. Now I see how it could be....  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title=";-)" /><!-- s;) -->	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm currently evaluating softwares to help manage racks and servers, and just saw that it might be added to ONA, which I'm already using for IP management.<br />
<br />
Is this feature still on the roadmap ? Is there anything to test ? May I help in any way ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for such a great tool <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) -->	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
