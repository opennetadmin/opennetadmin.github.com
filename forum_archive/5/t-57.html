	I've recently added an SVN repository so you can check out the latest trunk release.  You can see the latest changelog info via that interface as well.<br />
<br />
<a>http&#58;//opennetadmin&#46;com/repos</a><br />
<br />
MP: fix for report lists that are empty. Also incremented the install index for new release<br />
MP: added the access key combo for a space to invoke the SAVE button on edit forms.. usually SHIFT+ALT+SPACE on Firefox. <br />
MP: formatting issues on cli output. fixed per yshollander's suggestions.<br />
MP: fixes for location module zip_code name.. also not all location fields are required as suggested by the edit form. playing with space as a save accesskey <br />
MP: plugin related work to allow plugins to show their own workspace plugin as well as tool menu items easier.<br />
MP: fixed a lame bug where new table sequences would not initialize properly. added suggest device function <br />
MP: fix message for no reports to list. <br />
MP: allow the ona_sql module to return the record data in an array for processes that want to use that information <br />
MP: fixed the custom attribute search methods for both hosts and subnets. <br />
MP: the show all ips on subnet window now also includes the last_response field 	<br />
MP: More reporting related work. Fixes for reports, fixes to some form focus and other minor cleanup <br />
MP: suggestions for adding an interface to an existing host. <br />
MP: added a report_run module. This allows you to run reports from the CLI if needed. <br />
MP: Minor README updates<br />
MP: auto create ptr is now an option when adding a host as well. <br />
MP: forgot to bump version numbers on host/subnet code.. also defaulted device type to nothing, this forces the user to pick something <br />
MP: removed the create a pointer domain message when adding subnets. now you will get an error when a PTR is created without a domain existing. The user must add the domain themselves. who knows if this will be good or not...<br />
MP: forgot to update version number and addptr option description <br />
MP: misc cleanup for dhcp_server module <br />
MP: added option when creating new interfaces, to automatically create a PTR record to the primary host. Also the add dns record gui now allows you to add a PTR record.<br />
MP: allow dhcp_server modules to use find_subnet function.. allows more flexability for the CLI commands. also a PTR example for dns_record_add <br />
MP: BUG #57 added a keep adding checkbox to vlan edits <br />
MP: fixed search results form so it actually clears the forms now and so that it will remember the last search that was done. Also prep new sql upgrade file <br />
MP: block edits now focus first field, made notes field bigger <br />
MP: fix on the blocks table.<br />
MP: fixed quick search so that it would work using MAC addresses that are associated with more than one host.<br />
MP: Fixed PTR related error when adding domain server association. Also field length issue for TXT records fixed<br />
MP: fixed bug where new version wouldnt allow you to change dns names on existing hosts. it was an ebegin not updating issue. <br />
MP: more minor updates per Timm S <br />
MP: missing drop table statement per Timm <br />
MP: quick add of a new module for this release</a>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
