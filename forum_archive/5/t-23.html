	A new version has been released.  The following is the raw SVN checkin changelog:<br />
<br />
MP: quick add of a new module for this release<br />
MP: some code cleanup in dhcp_server module. fixed an issue where you could not remove a dhcp server from a subnet without deleting attributes. logic didnt make sense<br />
MP: initial work on a custom attribute display module.. should be mostly functional, not a lot of testing went into it though<br />
MP: BUG#53 fixed. CTRL-C characters wont render in the browser correctly. we still store them but I strip them just before I display them in the browser. Also usage text fixed in config_diff module<br />
MP: more fixes updates for the merged search form<br />
MP: commented out the template admin option for now<br />
MP: install process updates for the pending release<br />
MP: finished the system configuration management interfaces. Still need to update the database with the right edit/delete flags<br />
MP: now you can manage config types!<br />
MP: BUG#47 Fixed issue where I was not displaying useful info to the user when an invalid location was used for adding hosts<br />
MP: forgot to check this in for BUG#44<br />
MP: BUG#44 I implemented all required fields are now underlined using a style sheet element called .input_required. for good or bad, its all consistent now.<br />
MP: many gui improvments. This adds new feature that the advanced search form is now part of search results tabs. Seems to make more sense this way and is a bit easier to use.<br />
MP: BUG#29. fixed issue that non PTR records could use in-addr.arpa domain. suggest domain name still shows it however. Also focused first field in the edit record form<br />
MP: BUG#36 now fixed. PTR records will be added by re-saving the A record. Also fixed some issues searching for names in quicksearch.<br />
MP: Big update to the find_host function.. now it can try to find deeper host/domain pairs.. I.E. host sub.example.com vs host.sub example.com<br />
      Also fixes so that when adding a new host, you can add with the name as host.sub and a domain of example.com without it matching sub.example.com instead.<br />
MP: more fixes for displaying proper lists with shared interfaces.<br />
MP: BUG#28, Now if you change the IP of an a record or the IP of an interface, your PTR domains will update their value if they change domains.<br />
MP: fixes to allow the interface list tooltip to show cluster interfaces as well. Fixes for list all ips to show proper cluster icons<br />
MP: misc updates to the about window.<br />
MP: BUG#41, implemented the dcm option for display block and display vlan campus. Also described the host action config file better<br />
MP: BUG#41. Initial work for fixing this bug. should eventualy use the workspace plugin method but its there for now<br />
MP: changed the subnet direct link to use the name instead of ID.. should work fine, just more user friendly<br />
MP: BUG#38 fix for inconsistant name for device types.<br />
MP: get report was not at the right log level, and now the sanitize_hostname function allows a wildcard of *<br />
MP: misc fixes for passing data into edit forms. fixed DNS record update for changing ips when there are no child interfaces<br />
MP: fix to allow edits to subnet names again!. minor update to display host to allow more info in reports etc<br />
MP: the actual report workspace module that displays available reports<br />
MP: misc updates and fixes for the reporting system. Adds report option to host and subnet display pages<br />
MP: limit the parse_options_string so that it splits on the first =&gt; only.. that way options can contain =&gt; in them as well if needed. Not a ton of testing but seems ok so far<br />
MP: new report functionality as well as a few updates for some new reports that are coming<br />
MP: manage and show last_response date for IP addresses.. nmap scan and others can update this added &quot;related blocks&quot; list to subnet allocation map<br />
MP: more updates to the host/domain issue for dns records.<br />
MP: fixed bug that wont allow you to change names from a subdomain to a higher level domain. test.int domain.com vs test int.domain.com.<br />
MP: fixed some issues with block and subnet naming rules. blocks were missing the space to - rule on modify. thanks Stephen H<br />
MP: added location variable to host action substitution. helps when you have things like nagios.boi.example.com or nagios.lax.example.com. this example assumes location reference is also part of the domain structure.<br />
MP: check in first new install sql update script for version 5 to 6<br />
MP: fixed the tab from username issue during login. tabs still dont seem to work in ie6 though? too bad for them<br />
       Fixed problem when adding a new host and providing an interface description. it now works the first time<br />
MP: Fixes to the following issues.<br />
       incorrectly allowed to add IP addresses that match the first and last ip of a pool range<br />
       incorrectly allowed to resize a subnet that abandoned dhcp pools<br />
       Alsosome dhcppool related cleanups.. thanks Eric W!<br />
MP: fixed a bug in that the list would not allow you to move from page to page<br />

MP: fixes for sysconf app<br />
MP: sysconf cleanup, much more to do there. prep install scripts for next ver<br />

MP: new sys configuration editor. needs a tone of work still<br />
MP: more dns/dhcp build related work.. removed serial # from the domain lists as well. Toggling the type of builds for dns and dhcp should now be done via sys_config settings.<br />
