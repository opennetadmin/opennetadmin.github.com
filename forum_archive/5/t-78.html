	Well it seems I introduced a bug in the last version.  It will cause certain updates to interfaces to blank out the MAC address that is in the database.<br />
<br />
I have fixed the bug and posted v09.09.15 in the download section.  I would recommend anyone that has version 09.09.12 to upgrade as soon as you are able to avoid any possible data loss (like I had.. good thing I followed my instructions and did a backup of my data first! <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":-)" /><!-- s:) --> )<br />
<br />
Sorry for any issues it may have caused.<br />
<br />
Thanks.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
