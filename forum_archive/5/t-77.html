Thanks again to all those who helped do testing and gave feedback!  It helps a ton, keep it up.<br />
<br />
MP: fixed up a few issues with domains. it will now prompt the user with a domain dialog for missing ptr zones (again) <br />
MP: updated the table changes in the initial install sql file <br />
MP: bumped the install index <br />
MP: fixed up some border radius tags for when CSS3 is all done. <br />
MP: more query speedups for list host.<br />
MP: fixed the display dns and dhcp related screens so they would finish displaying THEN build the config to display.. helps with large configs <br />
MP: minor fixes to install update script.. added menu option to edit menu to add domain.<br />
MP: not sure if these changes are ok or not but so far they work. may break older firefox browsers from displaying cursor properly in edit forms<br />
MP: Per forum discussion with tin. added clickable link to open domain edits when there is a primary_master alert. <br />
MP: added a dns record search tab to the search dialog. now you can narrow down based on DNS records globally. <br />
MP: fixed issue when deleting a domain from a server. It may not always find an NS record. It now handles this more appropriately. <br />
MP: fixed display domain so it would only warn about primary master names not in the database as ANY dns type. before it had to be a primary DNS name. <br />
MP: checkin of next sql updates so far <br />
MP: remove host action edit button. also fix for host queries <br />
MP: misc desktop changes and menu changes. now there is a different login dialog as well<br />
MP: cleanup for edit host related to auto ptr <br />
MP: updates for DNS related changes. Now have a rebuild_flag in the dns_server_domains table to determine if a domain needs to be rebuilt for a specific server. These changes will trigger this flag to indicate that the server needs to rebuild the domain. still need to update build code so that it will reset the build flag. <br />
MP: fixes when deleting hosts/interfaces, now it deletes all the DNS records and the last device record as it should. Also add/modify code for more complex host to device associations are now in place. <br />
MP: changed default php error reporting to ignore &quot;notice&quot; level messages, ONA prints tons of these and they are not important. this way your hard drive wont fill with useless logs <br />
MP: display message in search results that indicates it was unable to find records and its going to display all records. Also Initial speed fixes for large datasets. Thanks Alberto for testing! <br />
MP: minor fixes to edit record for interface. added &quot;add dns record&quot; to edit menu. fix for dropdowns in some tooltips <br />
MP: more minor fixes for menu and desktop <br />
MP: fix for empty plugin lists <br />
MP: SERIOUS CHANGES TO BROWSER COMPATABILITY SUPPORT AND MAIN DESKTOP! New menu!, new &quot;desktop plugin modules&quot;, better cross browser support! yippie (more testing to come!) <br />
MP: fixed issue with the config div resizing <br />
MP: fixes to allow the standalone login page to work properly <br />
MP: added /32 bit mask options to tooltips, added manage plugins option <br />
MP: FIXED #37.. Now we are able to add both /32 and /31 subnets and hosts to those subnets.<br />
MP: fixes in prep for /32 /31 masks.. much input validation for spaces etc.<br />
MP: some input validation fixes <br />
MP: plugin related changes. test for disabled plugins <br />
MP: quick fix for the add dns box &quot;not opening&quot; when you select it from the interface menu popup. <br />
MP: similar width display fixes as the last commit<br />
MP: long TXT records were not editable via the GUI, also they did not display properly on views that generated lists or DNS configurations. Thanks Klaus!<br />
MP: minor fixes to the recent changes to html_desktop <br />
MP: refactor the main desktop to allow plugins! yippie.. er not??? <br />
MP: fix to allow DHCP entries related to the server. requires new server_id column in the table <br />
MP: changed from require_once to require for the workspace module loading.. allows more than one instance of the same module on the page. removed find server function <br />
MP: found many other nasty issues with the way I did the sql variable counting. fixed them all up.. its better now.........ahh <br />
MP: due to the new dataarray variable I had to bump up the sqlopts counter. forgot to do it before.	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
