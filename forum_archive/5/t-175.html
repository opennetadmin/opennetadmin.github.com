	A new version is FINALLY available.  It has many bug fixes and refinements.  Also it now includes an auth framework that allows for various authentication backends.  I'm including an LDAP authentication backend as part of this release.  More documentation on that later but you can find the config file in www/config/auth_ldap.config.php, then set the system conf variable &quot;authtype&quot; to ldap.<br />
<br />
Here is a quick list of updates:<br />
